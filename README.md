Django Channels with HTMX

This is a Proof-of-Concept demonstration of using HTMX connecting to a Django Channel

I've made the smallest implementation I could to focus on the minimal requirements.

You run this demo the same way you run the regular Channels tutorial.

The URL /chat/ is the standard tutorial URL. The htmx version is accessed at /htmx/.
